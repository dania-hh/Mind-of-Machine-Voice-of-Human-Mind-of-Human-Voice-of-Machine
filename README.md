<div align="center"> Creating conversations where each speaker contains both an AI and human element of speech and text - one speaker is a human that reads text generated by AI, and the other speaker is a text-to-speech generator that reads human-generated text.   
Which one sounds more human though? If so, why?   
This project also symbolizes the artificial and natural lives we live represented through sound and text.
